 This project is a simple command-line tool based on Java that analyzes the depth of HTML tags in a web page. When given a URL, it fetches the page content, identifies the tag with the maximum depth, and outputs both the tag name and its content. This code was developed as part of the selection process for an intern software engineer position at Axur.
